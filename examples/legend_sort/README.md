# Legend Sort

This example demonstrates how to control the sorting order of legend entries. It shows how to use `follow_insertion_order()` to display legend entries in the order they were added to the plot, rather than alphabetically, which is useful for maintaining a specific visual hierarchy in the legend.

## Running

Native
```sh
cargo run -p legend_sort
```

Web (WASM)
