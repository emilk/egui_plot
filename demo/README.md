# Demo Gallery

Demo gallery collects all the `examples/` into a browsable gallery.

## Contributions welcome!

[Contributions](../CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!

When you create a new example, first copy an existing one to have the same structure.
A good example to copy is `examples/box_plot`.

If you'd like to improve the gallery itself, please take a look at following issues:

## Features

- Search/filter by tags: https://github.com/emilk/egui_plot/issues/172
